# Hurricane-Damage-Detector-with-RESNET50

Welcome to the Hurricane Damage Detector project! My aim is to leverage satellite imagery data from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to identify damaged buildings. The dataset, sourced from [https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/detecting-damaged-buildings-post-hurricane-satellite-imagery-based-customized](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/detecting-damaged-buildings-post-hurricane-satellite-imagery-based-customized), will be invaluable for this purpose. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, which are used to train and validate the model, respectively.

## Running the Notebook

Due to the computational requirements of the project, I recommend running the Jupyter notebook on platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks that provide access to high-performance machines. The notebook includes all the necessary code to download the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook.
2. Run each cell in order to execute the code.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook for further exploration and understanding of the project.

Please note that due to the complexity and computational demand of the project, some cells may take a significant amount of time to run, especially on weaker hardware.

## Project Structure

- `hurricane_detector.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the project code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to get started.

## Dependencies

The project relies on Python, TensorFlow, and other necessary libraries. If you're running the notebook on Google Colab, these dependencies will be automatically installed. If you're running it on a local machine, you'll need to ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- tqdm
- glob

Please refer to the notebook for more detailed instructions on installing these dependencies.

I hope you find the Hurricane Damage Detector project interesting and engaging. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
